# Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test : A non-parametric Test for Goodness of fit

We have done Simulation studies related to Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. We have verified different theoretical results and have assessed the performance of
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as a test for goodness of fit through Monte-Carlo Simulation. We have also considered the cases where the assumptions
of the test are not valid. In addition, we have compared it with other *distance-based tests* - Smoothed Kernel Type Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic,
Cramér–von Mises test,Anderson–Darling test and Berk-Jones Test.

It is a group project of Uttaran Chatterjee, Adrija Saha, and Shrayan Roy under the guidance of respected Prof. Dr. Isha Dewan at ISID.
