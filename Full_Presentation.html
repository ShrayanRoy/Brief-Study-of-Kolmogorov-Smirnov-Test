# Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test as a Test of Goodness-of-Fit :

- Suppose we have a random sample `\(X_1,X_2,....X_n\)` from some population. We want to fit a distribution to the unknown population by that what we mean is that we want to check that whether the sample can be considered as random sample from a population with a continuous distribution function `\(F_o\)` which is completely specified (for now) to us.

- Hence we set our null hypothesis as `$$\mathcal{H}_o : F(x)=F_o(x) \ for \ all \ x \in \mathbb{R}$$`

- We can consider several alternate hypothesis from the as, `$$\mathcal{H}_1 : F(x)\neq F_o(x) \ for \ some \  x\in \mathbb{R}\ , \ \mathcal{H}_2 : F(x) \geq F_o(x) \ or \ \mathcal{H}_3 : F(x)\leq F_o(x)\  for \ all \ x\in \mathbb{R}$$`. 
---

- In our testing problem we basically want to estimate `\(F\)` and check whether it agrees or disagrees with our above hypothesis.

- Since as we know for a fixed value of `\(x\)` the quantity `\(F(x)\)` is nothing but a probability value which we generally not aware of, and our natural intuition of proportion and our inclination towards averages insists us to define an estimate of `\(F(x)\)` as,
`$$\mathbb{F}_n(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{1_{\{X_i \leq x\}}}$$`
- This function defined above is called the empirical distribution function.

---

# Empirical Distribution Function(ECDF) as an Estimator of the Distribution Function :

- Some quick observations that we can make immediately is that,
- `$$n\mathbb{F}_n(x) \sim Binomial(n, F(x)).$$`

- Also, `\(\textbf{Weak Law of Large Numbers}\)` tells us, 
 `\(\mathbb{F}_n(x) \overset{\mathbb{P}}{\to} F(x)\)` as `\(n \to \infty\)` for every `\(x\in \mathbb{R}\)`
 
- Hence we see that the empirical distribution function is weakly(infact strongly) consistent for the true distribution function.

# Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic : 

- The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic is defined as,
`$$D_n= Sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{F}_n(x)-F_o(x)|.$$`

- Further we can also define, 
`$${D_n}^+=Sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{F}_n(x)-F_o(x)) \ and \ {D_n}^-=Sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}(F_o(x)-\mathbb{F}_n(x))$$`

- What the quantity `\(D_n\)` is actually quantifying is the distance two functions `\(\mathbb{F}_n\)` and `\(F\)` under the supremum metric. 
- Hence, if our sample `\(X_1,....,X_n\)` is really a sample drawn from `\(F_o\)` then we expect `\(D_n\)` (even `\(D_n^+\)` and `\(D_n^-\)` ) to give negligible value.
-Hence we reject null for large values of `\(D_n\)` (or `\(D_n^+\)` or `\(D_n^-\)`).

---

# Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem - The Fundamental Statistical Theorem :

- One of the theoretical motivation behind the use of this Kolmogorov statistic is the following theorem -

- `\(\textbf{Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem}\)`

 For `\(\{X_n\}_{n\geq 1}\)` be a sequence of random variables from a probability space `\((\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})\)`. If we define the empirical distribution function (edf) as defined earier, then we have,
 `$$\mathbb{P}\left(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |\mathbb{F}_n(x)-F(x)|=0\right)=1$$`

 
- This theorem was proved by Glivenko for continuous distributions and the Cantelli proved the theorem for any distribution function.

- What the theorem says is remarkable and strong as it says that the true distribution function `\(F\)` can be `\(\textit{rediscovered from the data}\)` after making sufficiently large numbers of observations.

---

# Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem - The Fundamental Statistical Theorem (Contd.) :


- The theorem says that suppose there are two experimenters A and B keep on taking sequence of observations from the same population, then for the A lets say her sample is `\(X_1(\omega), X_2(\omega),.......\)`  and B has drawn her sample to be `\(X_1(\omega'),X_2(\omega'),.......\)` for `\(\omega,\omega' \in \Omega\)` respectively, the theorem above ensures that the empirical distribution function `\(\mathbb{F}_n(x)\)` converges to `\(F(x)\)` uniformly in `\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)` such that `\(\omega, \omega' \in N \subseteq \Omega\)` and `\(\mathbb{P}(N)=1\)`.

- Hence, it was quite rightfully referred as the `\(\textbf{Fundamental Statistical Theorem}\)` by Renyi and as `\(\textbf{Central Statistical Theorem}\)` by Loeve.

- Clearly, one of the immediate consequence of this theorem is `\(\textbf{Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test}\)` which we will be studying in detail through simulations.

#Asymptotic Distribution of `\(\sqrt n D_n\)` under H1

* To test `\(H_0\)`: `\(F_X\)` = `\(F_0\)` for all `\(x\)` Vs. `\(H_1\)`: `\(F_X(x)  \not= F_0(x)\)` for some `\(x\)`

* Here also, We have several choices of alternatives !

# What if the data is Censored?

* We know, if some of observations `$$X_1,X_2,...,X_n$$` are missing, we say that the data is censored.

--

* Censoring may happen in 2 ways:
                                  1. Type-1 Censoring
                                  2. Type-2 Censoring
                                  
* If it is decided to follow the experiment say upto r items are failed, is called Type-2 Censoring.

--

- For Type-2 Censored data, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic for 2-sided test is:

 `\(_2D{r,n}\)` = `\(\sup_{0 \le z \le Z_{(r)}}|F_n(z)-z|\)` = `\(max_{1 \le i \le r}\left|\frac{i-0.5}n-Z_{(i)}\right| + \frac{0.5}n\)`

* Here, we have simulated distribution of  `\(_2D{r,n}\)` for different distributions &amp; different values of `\(r\)`.

* More details are available in [Ralph B. D’Agostino &amp; Michael A. Stephens : Goodness-Of-Fit-Techniques](https://www.hep.uniovi.es/sscruz/Goodness-of-Fit-Techniques.pdf)

#Confidence Band for `\(F(x)\)` :

- We know that the confidence band is a random band which covers the Distribution Function `\(F\)` with a preassigned probability.
- Hence that `\((1-\alpha)100\)`%  confidence band for `\(F\)` can be derived as,
`\(\mathbb{P}(L_n(x)\leq F(x)\leq U_n(x))=1-\alpha\)`
where, `\(L_n(x)=\max(0,\mathbb{F_n}(x)-d_{n,\alpha})\)` and `\(U_n(x)=\min(\mathbb{F}_n(x)+d_{n,\alpha},1)\)`

# Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Partially Specified Null Hypothesis :

- Till now, what ever observations we made was based on taking the null hypothesis to be completely specified.

- Let us consider the problem when the null hypothesis is not completely specified as the above cases.

- In particular let us consider the null as, `$$\mathcal{H}_o: X_1,...,X_n \overset{iid}{\sim} N(\mu,1); \mu \in \mathbb{R}$$`

- We first see compute the `\(D_n^+\)` under `\(\mathcal{H}_o\)`  statistic for a sample `\(X_1,...X_{100}\)` drawn from `\(N(\mu,1)\)` where `\(\mu\)` is unknown.

- Since we don't know `\(\mu\)` we estimate `\(\mu\)` by the sample mean `\(\bar{X_n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{100}X_i\)` and take `\(\hat{F_o}= N(\bar{X_n},1)\)` to calculate `\(D_n^+ = \sup_x (\hat{F_o}(x)-\mathbb{F}_n(x))\)`.

# Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Partially Specified Null Hypothesis :

&lt;img src="Full_Presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- We see that the distribution is heavily positively skewed but the fit with the exact distribution of `\(D_n^+\)` is not good. 

---

# Convergence of `\(D_n\)` under Partially Specified Null Hypothesis :

- From the heavily positive skewness of the distribution of `\(D_n^+\)` under the Partially Specified Null Hypothesis we get the indication that even though we don't know the exact null distribution, the statistic `\(D_n\)` tend to go to `\(0\)`, detecting Normality in the data. 

&lt;img src="Full_Presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Hence we see that even under the Partially Specified Null Hypothesis, the statistic `\(D_n\)` indeed goes to `\(0\)` if the data is really drawn from a Normal population.

---
# Kolmogorov Statistic under Partially Specified Null Hypothesis for Exponential with unknown mean

- Here we consider the Null Hypothesis to be `\(\mathcal{H}_o: X_1,...,X_n \overset{iid}{\sim} Exponential(mean=\theta)\)`. 
- We estimate the rate by `\(\bar{X_n}^{-1}\)`(reciprocal of the sample mean).We plot the distribution of `\(D_n^+\)` and the check the convergence of `\(D_n\)` with the estimated value of `\(\theta\)`.
&lt;img src="Full_Presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;&lt;img src="Full_Presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- We see comparing the distribution with the case of Normal the distribution of `\(D_n^+\)` is not distribution free anymore but still remains positivey skewed indicating the rejection of null for large values of `\(D_n\)`.
- But surprisingly we see that `\(D_n\)` doesn't converge to 0 anymore. Hence Glivenko-Cantelli fails to hold true.

 we construct the following sequence of random variables- `\(Y_1\)` = `\(X_1\)`, `\(Y_2\)` = `\(2Min(X_1,X_2)\)`,..... are dependent **Exponential(1)** r.v.
 
&gt;-  Dependent Normal(0,1) Random Variables :

* Consider sequence of independent **Normal(0,1)** random variables `\(X_1,X_2,....\)`. Now,
 we construct the following sequence of random variables- `\(Y_1\)` = `\(X_1\)`, `\(Y_2\)` = `\(\frac{Y_1 + Y_2}{\sqrt 2}\)`,..... are dependent **Normal(0,1)** r.v.

&gt;- Dependent Cauchy(0,1) Random Variables :

* Consider sequence of independent **Cauchy(0,1)** random variables `\(X_1,X_2,....\)`. Now,
 we construct the following sequence of random variables- `\(Y_1\)` = `\(X_1\)`, `\(Y_2\)` = `\(\frac{Y_1 + Y_2}{2}\)`,..... are dependent **Cauchy(0,1)** r.v.

# What happens in Multivariate set up ?

- So far, in our discussion, we have talked about one-variate random variables, say `\(X_1, X_2,...,X_n\)`.

--

- Now, one general question that may occur in our mind is that whether all these results are valid if we consider p-variate random vectors `\(\textbf{X}_i\)`  ,for all `\(i=1,2,...,n\)`.

--

- Does Glivenko Cantelli Theorem holds true?

--

- Does Same set up of Kolmogorov Test can be used in multivariate set up?

--

- Let us restrict ourselves in 2-variate case only.

---

#Does Glivenko Cantelli Theorem hold here ?

- Let us consider a sample from a bivariate population with Distribution Function `\(F(x,y)\)` as `\((X_1,Y_1),....,(X_n,Y_n)\)`

- So, let us define the Empirical Distribution function as,
`$$\mathbb{F}_n(x,y)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n1_{\{X_i\leq x ;Y_i \leq y\}}$$`
- Hence, the analogous Kolmogorv Statistic in this set up will be,
`\(D_n= \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}; y\in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{F}_n(x,y)-F(x,y)|\)`

- By Glivenko-Cantelli we have,
`\(\mathbb{P}(\lim_{n\to \infty}D_n =0)=1\)`

#Smoothed Kernel Type Kolomogorov-Smirnov Statistic :

* We have already an idea about Kernel Density Estimation.

--

* But here, We are interested in **Kernel  CDF  Estimation**.

--

* If Kernel Density estimator is defined as - 

`$$\hat{f_n}(x,h) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} K(\frac{x - X_i}{h})$$`

* Then, Kernel CDF estimator is defined as - 

  `$$\hat{F_n}(x,h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} W(\frac{x - X_i}{h})$$`

* Where, `\(W(x)\)` = `\(\int_{-\infty}^{\ x} K(y) \; dy\)`

* In kernel density estimation also, we have some boundary problems. Similarly here also we have boundary problems. 

---

#Dealing with Boundary Problems :

* With Little Modifications we will achieve smoothed kernel type estimator :

`$$\hat{f_n}(x;h,t) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} K(\frac{t(x) - t(X_i)}{h})t^{'}(x)$$`
* Where `\(t(.)\)` is "good" and "Well-defined" function corresponding to the problem.

* Following the above notation Kernel CDF estimator is defined as - 

`$$\hat{F_n}(x,h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} W(\frac{t(x) - t(X_i)}{h})$$`

* Where, `\(W(.)\)` is defined before.

* We will use a [Nils Lid Hjort, Ingrid K. Glad : Parametrically guided kernel density estimation](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-23/issue-3/Nonparametric-Density-Estimation-with-a-Parametric-Start/10.1214/aos/1176324627.full) approach for choosing optimal kernel and bandwidth.

* It's implementation is available in [kdensity](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kdensity/kdensity.pdf) package in R.

# The Test-Statistic and it's distribution :

* The test statistic is given by - 

 `$$\tilde{D_n} = Sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{\tilde{F}}_n(x)-F_o(x)|$$`
* `\(\sqrt{n}\tilde{D_n}\overset{\mathbb{P}}{\to}0\)` as, `\(n\to \infty\)` 

* Also, It's Asymptotic distribution is given by - 

`$$\lim_{n\to\infty}P(\sqrt{n}\tilde{D_n}\le{x}) = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{x}\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}exp[{\frac{-(2i - 1)^2\pi^2}{8x^2}}]$$`

#Cramér–von Mises test

- For the same hypothesis that we test in two-sided Kolmogorov Test,i.e.,
Given `\(X_1,X_2,...,X_n \overset{i.i.d}{\sim} F\)`, for testing `\(H_0: F = F_0\)` vs `\(H_1: F \not = F_0\)` , where `\(F\)` is the distribution function associated with the random variables.

--

- This test statistic uses **Quadratic Distance** between `\(F_n(x)\)` and `\(F_0(x)\)` .
`$$W_n^2:= n \int (\mathbb{F}_n(x)-F_0(x))^2 dF_o(x)$$`

--

- If `\(H_0\)` is true, this statistic tends to be small. So, we need to reject `\(H_0\)` for large values of `\(W_n^2\)`.

--
- This statistic can be further simplified as:

`$$W_n^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\left\{U_{(i)}-\frac{2i-1}{2n}\right\}^2+\frac{1}{12n}$$`
where `\(U_{(j)}\)` stands for `\(j^{th}\)` sorted `\(U_i = F_0(X_i)\)`
---
- **Distribution under `\(H_0\)` :**
If `\(H_0\)` holds and `\(F_0\)` is continuous, Then `\(W_n^2\)` has an asymptotic distribution with CDF given by,

`$$\lim_{n\to \infty} \mathbb{P}(W_n^2\leq x)=1-\frac{1}{\pi}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{j-1}W_j(x)$$`
where,
`$$W_j(x):=\int_{(2j-1)^2\pi^2}^{4j^2\pi^2}\sqrt{\frac{-\sqrt{y}}{sin\sqrt{y}}}\frac{e^{-\frac{xy}{2}}}{y}dy$$`

--
- This test is distribution free if `\(F\)` is continuous and the sample has no ties.

---

# Anderson–Darling test

- For the same hypothesis that we test in two-sided Kolmogorov Test,i.e.,
Given `\(X_1,X_2,...,X_n \overset{i.i.d}{\sim} F\)`, for testing `\(H_0: F = F_0\)` vs `\(H_1: F \not = F_0\)` , where `\(F\)` is the distribution function associated with the random variables.

--

- This statistic uses **Weighted Quadratic distance** between `\(F_n(x)\)` and `\(F_0(x)\)` weighted by `\(w_0(x)\)` = `\(F_0(x)(1-F_0(x))^{-1}\)`.

--

`$$A_n^2 := n \int \frac{(F_n(x)-F_o(x))^2}{F_o(x)(1-F_o(x))}dF_o(x)$$`

--

- If `\(H_0\)` is true, this statistic tends to be small. So, we need to reject `\(H_0\)` for large values of `\(A_n^2\)`.
- It can be noted that, compared to `\(W_n^2\)`, `\(A_n^2\)` puts more weights on the deviation between `\(F_n(x)\)` and `\(F_0(x)\)`  that happens on the tail,
i.e. when `\(F_0(x)\)` `\(\approx\)` `\(0\)` or `\(F_0(x)\)` `\(\approx\)` `\(1\)`

---

- This statistic can be further simplified as:
`$$A_n^2= -n -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \left\{ (2i-1)log(U_{(i)})+(2n+1-2i)log(1-U_{(i)}) \right\}$$`

--

- **Distribution under `\(H_0\)` :**

If `\(H_0\)` holds and `\(F_0\)` is continuous, Then `\(A_n^2\)` has an asymptotic distribution given by,
`$$\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{Y_j}{j(j+1)}, \text{where} \ Y_j\sim \chi_1^2,j\geq 1, \text{are iid}$$`

# Berk-Jones Test

- In a 1979 paper, Berk and Jones suggested an intuitively appealing method of testing simple goodness-of-fit null hypothesis.

--

- The Berk-Jones method is just transform the entire goodness-of-fit problem to a Binomial testing problems.

--

- The key fact that it uses is, if `\(F\)` is the underlying true CDF then for every `\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)`, `\(n\mathbb{F}_n(x) \sim Binomial(n,F(x))\)`.

- So, for given null hypothesis `\(\mathcal{H}_o:F=F_o\)` , for every `\(x\)` what we really want to check is `\(p(x)=p_o(x)\)` where `\(p(x)=\mathbb{P}(X \leq x)\)`.

- We can use a likelihood ratio test corresponding to two-sided or one-sided alternative to this hypothesis. Hence we need to maximize the binomial likelihood function with respect to `\(F(x)\)` for every value of `\(x\in \mathbb{R}\)`. 

---

# Constructing the Likelihood Ratio Test

-  The maximum likelihood of `\(F(x)\)` is calculated to be `\(\mathbb{F}_n(x)\)`. Hence we have the likelihood ratio statistic ,
--
-$$\lambda_n(x)=\frac{\mathbb{F}_n(x)^{n\mathbb{F}_n(x)}(1-\mathbb{F}_n(x))^{n-n\mathbb{F}_n(x)}}{\mathbb{F}_o(x)^{n\mathbb{F}_n(x)}(1-\mathbb{F}_o(x))^{n-n\mathbb{F}_n(x)}}$$ 
`$$=\left(\frac{\mathbb{F}_n(x)}{F_o(x)}\right)^{n\mathbb{F}_n(x)}\left(\frac{(1-\mathbb{F}_n(x))}{(1-F_o(x))}\right)^{n-n\mathbb{F}_n(x)}$$`
--

- But since we want to check whether `\(F(x)=F_o(x)\)` for all `\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)`. So it makes sense we take the supremum of `\(\lambda_n\)` over all `\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)`.

--

- Hence the Berk-Jones Statistics is,
   `$$R_n= n^{-1} \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}log(\lambda_n(x)).$$`
---

# Berk-Jones Statistic

- The interesting thing about the statistic `\(R_n\)` is it's connection to the Kullback-Leibler Distance between two Binomial populations.

--

- The Kulback-Liebler Distance between two distributions `\(Binomial(n,p)\)` and `\(Binomial(n,\theta)\)` is defined as,
  `$$K(p,\theta)=plog\left(\frac{p}{\theta}\right)+(1-p)log\left(\frac{1-p}{1-\theta}\right).$$`
--

- Hence we can write,
  `$$R_n= \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}K(\mathbb{F}_n(x),F(x)).$$`
--

- Hence we reject `\(\mathcal{H}_o\)`, for large values of `\(R_n\)`.
--

- But computing this statistic in R is very difficult because of the `\(Supremum\)`. 
--

- Referring back to the original paper of Berk and Jones(1970) and a recent paper Amit Moscovich and Boaz Nadler(2016), we see that instead of working with `\(R_n\)`, we can work with the Likelihood Ratio Statistic `\(\lambda_n(x)\)` itself taking the arguments as a Order statistics of the sample, `\(X_{(1)},X_{(2)},....,X_{(n)}\)`.

---

# Computing the Exact Berk-Jones Statistic

- Using the fact that under `\(\mathcal{H}_o\)`, we know `\(U_i=F_o(X_i) \overset{i.i.d}{\sim} Unif(0,1)\)`, for `\(F_o\)` continuous.

--

- Hence, `\(U_{(1)},U_{(2)},....,U_{(n)}\)` are order statistics from a sample of size `\(n\)` from `\(Unif(0,1)\)`.


- Berk-Jones(1970) showed that `\(R_n\)` and `\(-n^{-1}log(M_n)\)` has same asymptotic properties. Hence,testing with respect to `\(R_n\)` and `\(M_n\)` are equivalent.

--

- Where `\(M_n=min(M_n^+,M_n^-)\)` where, `\(M_n^+ := min_{1 \leq i \leq n}\mathbb{P}(Beta(i,n-i+1)&lt; u_{(i)})\)` and `\(M_n^- :=min_{1 \leq i \leq n}(1-\mathbb{P}(Beta(i,n-i+1)&lt; u_{(i)}))\)`.

- Hence, we calculate this `\(M_n\)` which is infact the called the `\(Exact Berk-Jones Statistic\)`.
 
---

# Distribution Free Nature of `\(M_n\)` :

- Here, we present the results of some simulation studies which exhibits the Distriution Free nature of `\(M_n\)`.

# Power Curve Comparison for Berk Jones :

- We saw earlier that Kolmogorov-Smirnov was failing to detect trunctated normal, truncated at -2 and 2. 
- This happens mostly because almost the entire probability of Normal is concentrated within -3 and 3.
- Here we try to address this problem using Berk-Jones Test. Can Berk-Jones detect very slight difference in tails ?
